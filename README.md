# Wait-for-permission
If you multi-opened programs that use bilibili's API platform, you will possibly be blocked. Try this small app, and it will try for permission so that you do not have to wait and try by yourself

Just put the program into the directory as the same as `main.js` in. Run it, and just look at the screen until it shows that bilibili's unblocked your visit to its API platform.
